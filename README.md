# Simple Sortable Tree
This goal of this project is to have a simple yet configurable interface for managing deeply nested sorted data via drag and drop. This current state of the project is early, and suffers from some simple but annoying usability issues.

Todo:
- Tests
- Improve Usability
- Ship with better base CSS
